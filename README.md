Project Story: Retail Intelligence from Raw POS Data

Problem
Retail POS data existed in raw Excel exports with no structured analytics layer. There was no consistent way to measure:

store performance

labor efficiency

promotion impact

customer behavior

Approach
I built a complete analytics pipeline:

Ingested Excel POS data into SQL

Cleaned and standardized transactional and labor datasets

Designed a multi-fact star schema

fact_sales

fact_labor

shared dimensions

Engineered KPIs in SQL + DAX

Delivered executive dashboards in Power BI

Solution
Created a scalable BI model that connects operations, finance, and customer analytics.

Impact
Enabled:

labor vs revenue optimization

promotion ROI analysis

store benchmarking

customer basket insights

operational risk monitoring (refunds)
